Used to send an email using Python modules only.

(Utils/utils.py client knows to use this module's send
function for sending emails when it's command line
parameter --emailer is set to "python".)

Usage:  (when used from the command line)
  ./send.py smtp_server [JSON_FILE_NAME]

Options:
  server  can be any of the keys defined in the
        Pymail.config.config dict.

Provides send.  (when imported as a module)

Have not yet implemented ability to use
a second command line argument to specify
a json file from which to load emails.
