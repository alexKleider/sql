The Hand Off!!
==============

Dues
----
The following have credits regarding their dues (inadvertently
paid twice or paid 100 instead of 200 and then corrected the
situation by paying the full 200 (insead of 100).)
    Knowles, Lauri, -200
    Nicolaus, Wendel, -200
    Korty, Jonathan, -100

Kayak Storage
-------------
See the accompanying "kayak_data.csv" csv file.
You can read it with any text editor (such as notepad) but may first
have to rename it "kayak_data.txt" for your system to allow you to do
that.
Alternatively as a csv file you should be able to import it into a
spread sheet of your own choosing if inclined to do so. YMMV


Dock Usage
----------
See "dock.csv" file. Ditto about reading it.
I have Leonardo Ferlinghetti still owing $25 for dock usage. I believe
this is because the fee went up from 75 to $100 but he only paid the
old fee.  Since his dues were paid this never became and issue; my
oversite!

Mooring Fee
-----------
See "moorings.csv" file. Ditto about reading it.
Note: I never resolved the fact that Mark Dolen underpaid his docking
fees by $70. This may be because Don charges by the foot (of boat
length) and it may be that I didn't (still don't) have the correct
cost/length recorded.
Rupert Dixon and Thorny Smith have credits (of 8 and 10 dollars
respectively) because they overpaid for dock usage last year.


Warning
=======
Please check with Don regarding the (kayak, dock and mooring) fees!
These are somewhat fluid as people come and go, etc.
