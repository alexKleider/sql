re: dock users:
    should John Vantress be on the dock users list??
    I've added Christian Morabito since Angie
    collected $75 from him.  Is that OK?
re kayak storage:
    I've arbitrarily assigned a 'slot number' to each.
    Have you 'named' slots in any way?  If so, please let me
    know and I'll try to adapt to your naming system rather
    than this arbitrary one.
re moorings:
    Regarding the Floating Docks, I've assigned odd numbers
    to the deep/ouside moorings and even numbers to the inside
    (perhaps unusable?) moorings. "U" is for the upper floating
    and "M" is for the middle floating dock. "S" is for the string
    of moorings.
    Should Josh be in an odd numbered slot?
    I believe you told me the inside moorings are too shallow
    to be useable.
    Let me know if you have a different way of designating the
    various spots and I'll try to modify my data to fit.
