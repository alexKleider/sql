ORIGIN:
    This Sql directory is where I'm experimenting with code that
    might eventually lead to a transition to using a relational
    data base for the Rod and Boat Club data.  It's still very
    much a work in progress.

    The Sanitized directory contains small 'dummy' data files
    mimicking the club's data files.

    Have moved to use of the Secret directory (which has current
    club data in it.
    Using main.py as driver.
    So far have implemented the show_cmd ==> 4web.txt

    For some time now Club affairs have been handled
    using this code base exclusively.


The ERD.txt file outlines the sql data base schema
(which has changed from time to time and may continue
to do so. For this reason the file can be updated 
using the erd.py code.)
