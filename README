    This Sql directory is where I'm experimenting with code that
    might eventually lead to a transition to using a relational
    data base for the Rod and Boat Club data.  It's still very
    much a work in progress.

    The Sanitized directory contains small 'dummy' data files
    mimicking the club's data files.

    Have moved to use of the Secret directory (which has current
    club data in it.
    Using main.py as driver.
    So far have implemented the show_cmd ==> 4web.txt
