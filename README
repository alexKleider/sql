    This Sql directory is where I'm experimenting with code that
    might eventually lead to a transition to using a relational
    data base for the Rod and Boat Club data.  It's still very
    much a work in progress.

    The Sanitized directory contains small 'dummy' data files
    mimicking the club's data files.
