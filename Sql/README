Evolving following suffix (before '.sql') conventions:

using suffix 'f' when query needs formatting before use.
using suffix 'ff' when two items need formatting.
using suffix 'fff' when three (or more) need formatting.
using suffix 'fd' when using a **dict to format.
in the case of 'ff' and 'fff' will probably switch to use of 'fd'
