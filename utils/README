This code is being written with the goal of collecting the names of
all methods in each module and then checking each module where the
method in question is _not_ defined for the existence of a call or
reference to that module and providing a listing of the line numbers
for each.

Data Structuring:
master[filename][func_name][filename][list_of_locations]
  master:
    dict keyed by 'code_file_names'
      values are dicts keyed by the names of functions defined there.
        values are dicts keyed by 'codefile_name" (all but the file in
        which the function was defined) (We don't locate functions used
        in the file in which they are declared. (subject to chane))
            values are listings of the locations where the function
            is called or referenced in the file.

Tests found in tests/test_utils_scan.py.
