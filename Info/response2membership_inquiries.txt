Thanks for your interest in the Bolinas Rod and Boat Club.

We are an organization dedicated to Water Safety, Recreation and Wildlife
Conservation.

The procedure to become a member is to find sponsors!
Club Membership is invitational with the requirement of sponsorship
by two members in good standing.  Your sponsor(s) can download an
application form for you and should provide help getting you through
the application process.

If/when we receive your application I'll get in touch again. 

Sincerely,
Alex Kleider (Membership)
