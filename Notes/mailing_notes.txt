# File: mailing_notes.txt

currently available:
    code.commands.prepare_mailing_cmd()
        -sets up holder (club.Holder())
            Probably don't need a "holder"
        -sets up mail_dir and email.json
            use code.club.[AX_MAIL_DIR | AX_EMAIL_JSON]
        -presents menu of content.ctypes
            predeterminded by where it appears
        and assigns to holder.which  [not needed]
        -prepares templates (also assigns printer)
            no need for printer info if only emails
            combines:
                salutation (ready for formatting)
                body
                email signature of sender
                postscripts if any
            assigns template to holder
        -sets up holder.emails = [] ...but in current use case,
        want to add to emails.json
        -runs holder.which['holder_funcs'] (assigns
        "working_data" == recipeints)
        -runs holder.which['funcs'] on each item in
        "working_data"
        -dumps the emails to email.json
        -checks mailing dir

MY PLAN
    set up an appendable json file for emails {  separate from
    set up a mail dir                         {  emails.json
                                              { & Secret/MailDir
        temp.json
        Secret/TempMail
