SQL RULES to remember:

1. Identifiers-that is Column and table names-(for example when they contain
embedded spaces) will require quotes: those quotes are <b>double</b> quotes.

2. Literals-that is the <b>value</b> of columns-will always require quotes:
those quotes are <b>single</b> quotes.

3. Curly quotes are unrecognised by SQL parsers except as literals i.e column values

This convention is rigid i.e. you have to abide.
