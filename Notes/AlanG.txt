Rich is good for text styles but I don't think it has all the
Window and full-screen cursor control of curses.

There is a Rich extension called Textual that has widgets etc,
but it seems to be based on CSS/HTML and I didn't like the mixed
mode of programming it required.

The package I was thinking of was urwid. A GUI like framework with
menus, dialogs windows etc. Event driven (no need to create your
own loop) and seems powerful - but I've only played with it...

I've used that too. Did you check out the 'dialog' module that I
mentioned in the book. It does a lot of what simplegui does but
all in the console. And you can test it out from an OS shell
prompt, no need to write Python code.

From what I recall simplegui pops up actual GUI dialogs on top
of your console application which I find
a)  rather disjointed and
b) totally useless if running an app over ssh on a server for example.
